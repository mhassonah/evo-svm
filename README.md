#### Guide:
* This project includes the implementation of many Metaheuristic Algorithms (MAs) on Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
* In this project, MAs are utilized in tuning (optimizing) SVM parameters and/or selecting features for minimization and maximization problems.
* This project uses LibSVM library.
* Main file to run is 'evo-svm.m'. Edit directory path to LibSVM toolbox, and Datasets folder. Specify all needed parameters in this file as well.
* User can add or remove as many MAs as needed. Make sure to add them in the 'evo_algorithms' folder and call them in code as shown for other algorithms. Also make sure that all files' names are unique in the entire project.
* This project uses paralell For loop for separate experiments in Matlab.
